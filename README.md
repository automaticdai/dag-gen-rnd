**dag-gen-rnd** --- A randomized multiple Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) task generator designed for scheduling and allocation research in parallel and multi-core computing. 

**dag-gen-rnd** supports both command line (`daggen-cli`) and graphical user interface (`daggen-gui`; in development). This generator can be easily configured through a `.json` file and is highly extensible for other purposes.

Supported generation algorithms:

- `nfj`: Nested fork-join
- `rnd`: standard randomized DAG (layer-by-layer)
- `rnd_legacy`: default randomized DAG

The utilization generation is based on:

- UUnifast [1]
- UUnifast-discard [2]

## Requirements

- `Python >= 3.7`
- `NetworkX >= 2.4`
- `Matplotlib >= 3.1.3`
- `pygraphviz >= 1.5`
- `numpy >= 1.17`
- `tqdm >= 4.45.0`
- `pyqt5` (optional for GUI)

---

## Installation on Linux

Install dependencies using apt:

`$ sudo apt install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config`

and then install Python depedencies through `requirements.txt`:

`$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

(Optional) To use the GUI, you need to install Qt5 for Python:

`$ sudo apt install python3-pyqt5`

---

## Configuration

Use the configuration file `config.json` to configure parameters.

(1) To generate single DAG task, set `multi-DAG=false`, then in `single_task`:

- `multi-DAG`: false
- `set_number`: number of tasksets
- `workload`: sum(C_i)

(2) To generate multi-DAG taskset, set `multi-DAG=true`, then in `multi_task`:

- `set_number`: number of tasksets
- `utilization`: total utilization
- `task_number_per_set`: number of tasks in each taskset
- `periods`: period set candidates

---

## Usage

First, change the configurations in `config.json`. Then, depending on your perference:

### 1. Use the command line interface

`$ python3 src/daggen-cli.py`


### 2. Use the graphic user interface (development in process)

`$ python3 src/daggen-gui.py`

To use the generated DAGs, see the provided API in `utlity.py` which also gives an example.

## Examples

Here are some simple examples of generated DAGs:

or more complicated DAGs that can also be generated:

## Known Issues

1. This code is tested on Linux (Ubuntu) but not on Windows. There should not be too many problems as Python is good at cross-platform. However, the only potential issue is that the difference is in folder naming where Windows uses a backslash (`\`), instead of a forwardslash (`/`). I will test it and make it compatitable in the future. 
2. In some cases, the workload of the critical path could be larger than the period. The generator does not prohibit this case as this is not treated as a bug. The users need to be aware this and deal with them in their favority way, e.g. discarding.
