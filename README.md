The **dag-gen-rnd** is a randomised multiple Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) task generator designed for scheduling and allocation research in parallel and multi-core computing. 
**dag-gen-rnd** supports both command line (`daggen-cli`) and graphical user interface (`daggen-gui`; in development). This generator can be easily configured through a `.json` file and is highly extensible for other purposes.

Support the following DAG generation algorithms:

- `nfj`: Nested fork-join
- `rnd`: standard randomised DAG (layer-by-layer; LBL)
- `rnd_legacy`: default randomised DAG

Supported utilisation generation algorithms:

- `UUnifast` [1]
- `UUnifast-discard` [2]

## Requirements

- `Python >= 3.7`
- `NetworkX >= 2.4`
- `Matplotlib >= 3.1.3`
- `pygraphviz >= 1.5`
- `numpy >= 1.17`
- `tqdm >= 4.45.0`
- `pyqt5` (optional for GUI)

---

## Installation on Linux

Install dependencies using apt:

`$ sudo apt install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config`

and then install Python dependencies through `requirements.txt`:

`$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

(Optional) To use the GUI, you need to install Qt5 for Python:

`$ sudo apt install python3-pyqt5`

---

## Configuration

Use the configuration file `config.json` to configure parameters.

### Single DAG

To generate a single DAG task, set `multi-DAG=false`, then in `single_task`:

- `multi-DAG`: false
- `set_number`: number of tasksets
- `workload`: sum(C_i)

### Multiple DAGs

To generate a multi-DAG taskset, set `multi-DAG=true`, then in `multi_task`:

- `set_number`: number of tasksets
- `utilization`: total utilisation
- `task_number_per_set`: number of tasks in each taskset
- `periods`: period set candidates

---

## Usage

### Use the cli

First, change the configurations in `config.json`. Then, run the command line interface:

`$ python3 src/daggen-cli.py`


### Use the GUI (development in process)

`$ python3 src/daggen-gui.py`

To use the generated DAGs, see the provided API in `utlity.py` which also gives an example.

## Known Issues

1. *Compatibility on Windows*: This code is tested on Linux (Ubuntu) but not on Windows. There should not be too many problems as Python is good at cross-platform. However, the only potential issue is that the difference is in folder naming, where Windows uses a backslash (`\`) instead of a forward slash (`/`). I will test it and make it compatible in the future. 
2. In some cases, the workload of the critical path could be larger than the period. The generator does not prohibit this case as this is not treated as a bug (as you can distribute the workload to multiple cores). The users need to be awareof  this and deal with them in their favourite way, e.g. discarding.
3. If you get an error while building pygraphviz during installing the dependencies, install graphviz with `apt install graphviz graphviz-dev`.
